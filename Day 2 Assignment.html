        <p class="three">Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the folloeing fables:A donkey that<br>
           is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself,only to<br>
           become more immobilized and attached to the post.The same thing applies to people with obbsessive<br>
           thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and<br>
           discomfort.</p>
